<blockquote>"It was such a relief when clients visiting our site were no longer confused by the lack of flow, wonky glitches, and  broken links. We absolutely have Geneva to thank for fixing that. Geneva remade our site into something perfectly streamlined, attractive, and easily navigable. The difference that made for our organization's online presence was clearly measurable. We're so thankful to her for all her dedication and willingness to fix glitches which had evaded so many people before her." <strong> - Mara Morken, Pride Collective and Community Center</strong>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote> "Geneva is a hard worker who is passionate about her craft. I've been working with her for about half a year, most of that time living in two separate countries, and I'm always impressed at how quickly she responds when I need help with something. She notices things I don't that she can do to make my blog better, and is proactive in improving the site. I couldn't ask for a better partner!" <strong>- Kirsten Hoaby, Adventure Addict</strong> </blockquote>
	<blockquote>"Geneva Nemzek is a brilliant convergence of natural skill and diligent hard work and dedication. Having served for over two years as President of the Straight and Gay Alliance (SAGA) at Concordia College, she has taken the time required to master the realm of social engagement, especially within the context of advocacy. Geneva is social media savvy with an informed and passionate mind for social justice. Her immediate responsiveness, natural yet profound language, and meticulous organization of responsibilities make her an invaluable asset to any team. A natural leader, Geneva is comfortable and dynamic directing others, able to maximize efficiency and comfort for those around her. Her aptitude for taking on new responsibilities and seamlessly transitioning to quality work is simply unparalleled. I could not recommend Geneva Nemzek highly enough."<strong> - Colin Sullivan, SAGA. </strong></blockquote>
